# Maze Generator
This Python-based maze generator creates random, solvable mazes of customizable size and displays them in color directly in the terminal using the Colorama library. The program initializes a grid of unexplored cells, then iteratively builds the maze by breaking walls while ensuring paths remain connected without loops. Walls, paths, and unexplored cells are visually distinguished with red, white, and blue colors, and the generator automatically creates entry and exit points for the maze.
